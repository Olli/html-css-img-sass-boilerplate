# HTML CSS IMG SASS Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for my daily workflow. If you are interested in adding something useful
please add a pull request.

If you use it you have to fork it and then run

``
bundle install
``

and after that you have to configure the Guardfile in /config/Guardfile
and run

``
guard
``

**Beware** its only for ruby 2.0 syntax

That's it!
